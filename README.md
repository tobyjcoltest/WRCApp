## Samaritan Worker Resource Center Application 

#About Samaritan House San Mateo 
Since 1974, Samaritan House has grown to become San Mateo Count's
leading non-profit that brings a new level of hope, dignity, and
empowerment to people living in poverty as they fulfill immediate needs
and guide people to self reliance. Recognized as a role model in the
community, Samaritan House is the largest food distribution agency in
the county. Its other free services include shelter and housing
assistance; medical and dental clinics; clothes for children;
personalized case management and much more.

#The worker resource center
The Worker Resource Center provides an alternative location for
temporary laborers and potential employers to meet for work. Managed
by Samaritan House and funded by the City of San Mateo, the Worker
Resource Center opened in 2003 with the goal of providing a safe place for
employers and employees to meet.

#Why the PayPal Opportunity Hack?
The PayPal Hack gives us a unique opportunity to demonstrate how technology
can help Samaritan House modernize a process that is currently done
with pen and paper and a tombola lottery system for choosing who gets
the opportunity to work via the WRC.

Technology can be a real enabler for link Samaritan House and
specifically the Worker Resource Center.  

The web application has been written to allow Workers and Employers to
register via a simple online form and the WRC to faciliate the matching
up of workers with employment.
